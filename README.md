This is a web application, built in ReactJS, Redux, and Firebase, that allows users to upload and keep track of jobs to which they've applied. 

NOTE: You will have to create your own Firebase account and replace the 'config' object in 'firebase.js' with the 'config' object from a new project in your personal account.

The ReactJS build was initialized through Create React App.
